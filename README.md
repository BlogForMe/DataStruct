If you are using CLion on a Mac and encountering the error fatal error: 'gmpxx.h' file not found, it suggests that the GMP library is not installed or not properly configured in your CLion project. Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve this issue:

1. Install GMP Library on Mac:
You can use Homebrew to install the GMP library on your Mac. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it from brew.sh.

Open Terminal and run the following commands:
```
brew install gmp
```
2. Locate the GMP Library:
After installation, Homebrew usually installs GMP in /usr/local/opt/gmp or /opt/homebrew/opt/gmp depending on your Homebrew installation path. You can confirm this by running:

```
brew --prefix gmp
```
3. Configure CLion to Use GMP:
  Open your CLion project.

Go to File > Settings (or CLion > Preferences on macOS).

Navigate to Build, Execution, Deployment > CMake.

In the CMake options field, add the following lines to include the GMP headers and libraries:

```
-DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/opt/gmp/include
-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/opt/gmp/lib
```
Adjust the paths if your Homebrew installation prefix is different.

4. Include GMP in Your Code:
   Ensure your code includes the GMP header correctly:
   ```
   #include <gmpxx.h>
   ```

6. Update CMakeLists.txt:
Make sure your CMakeLists.txt is configured to link against the GMP library. Add the following lines:

```
find_library(GMP_LIBRARY NAMES gmp)
find_library(GMPXX_LIBRARY NAMES gmpxx)
include_directories(/usr/local/opt/gmp/include)
link_directories(/usr/local/opt/gmp/lib)
target_link_libraries(your_target_name ${GMP_LIBRARY} ${GMPXX_LIBRARY})
```
